Accessible Collapsibles
=====================

jQuery plugin for accessible, unobtrusive collapsibles.  I think it's great for use with FAQs or any 
items where you show/hide content.  It is keyboard and mouse navigable, with visual indicators for focus.  I have ARIA 
attributes assigned to the different items and states, but any help anyone can provide to make it more screen-reader 
friendly (or just... better, period) would be greatly appreciated.


Work that needs to be done:

I need to get rid of some of the superfluous javascripts, tighten up the JS and CSS and then provide minified versions

Future plans:
